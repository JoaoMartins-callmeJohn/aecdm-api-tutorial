# AEC Data Model API Tutorial

## Introduction

In this tutorial we'll cover the first steps to experiment the AEC Data Model API in a quick and simple way. At first, we'll go through the pre-requisites required to make everything work, and then we'll have a basic intro to the GraphQL interface (used by this API).

Once we got that covered, we'll run from basic queries to more advanced ones, always using the explorer, just like in the image below.

So don't worry if you're not a full-stack web developer, you don't need that to follow up this tutorial (although you will need to connect with one to build your own app leveraging our APIs).

As long as you have familiarity with AEC industry workflows, Revit designs concepts, and curious about new technologies, you're in a good shape to go through the contents shared here.

This tutorial is divided in 4 main steps:

1. [Requisites and GraphQL]({{ site.baseurl }}/requisites/home/)

2. [Explorer and First Queries]({{ site.baseurl }}/explorer/home/)

3. [Connecting with Viewer and Advanced Queries]({{ site.baseurl }}/connection/home/)

4. [Additional Workflows]({{ site.baseurl }}/workflows/home/)
