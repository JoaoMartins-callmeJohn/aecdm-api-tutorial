# About this tutorial

The purpose of this tutorial is to showcase the new AEC Data Model API. This tutorial shouldn't be your first step with APS. If you're experimenting APS for the very first time, please go to [APS Tutorials page](http://aps.autodesk.com/tutorials).

In the content shared with this tutorial, we'll go through a subset of queries you can make using the new AEC Data Model API (currently in public beta).
We'll walk you through the pre-requisites, initial workflows, advanced queries and some interesting cases that can be covered using this API.

If you're interested in any of the following cases, then this tutorial is suitable to you:

1. Querying metadata from your Revit designs \*
2. Take advantage of cross-project queries \*
3. Query design data from hub level \*
4. Take advantage of the benefits of working with a GraphQL interface
5. Experiment with the queries without the need of building any sample.

\* Limited to Revit 2024 files hosted on ACC allow-listed hubs
